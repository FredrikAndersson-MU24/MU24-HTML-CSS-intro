    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to this short text where I share my thoughts on learning in
      general and
      <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in particular.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>
      There are several things to consider when preparing to learn a new
      programming language. At least for me. Below I have listed some of the
      most important ones.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make a schedule - Schedule time for focused work and time for recovery
      </li>
      <li>Focus - Turn off all notifications during your focus time</li>
      <li>Take breaks - Get out of your chair and take a walk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>More important stuff</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some more things that are easy to forget when you have got your
      study mode on, but it is imparative that you don't. Further down I give a
      more in-depth description of each topic.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#eat">Eat</a></li>
      <li><a href="#sleep">Sleep</a></li>
      <li><a href="#love">Love</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="eat">Eat</h3>
    <p class="h3-p">
      It is crucial that your energy deposits are not depleted. Maintain a
      steady energy level, otherwise you might find yourself struggling trying
      to maintain focus.
    </p>
    <h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>
    <p class="h3-p">
      I have always heard that when you sleep is when you actually learn the
      things you've studied during the day. Having to little sleep can also
      affect your ability to maintain your focus during lessons.
    </p>
    <h3 is="love">Love</h3>
    <p class="h3-p">
      Hey, it is important to remember that there are other things in life than
      just work. Spend time with your loved ones as often as you can.
